                        We can't talk about Information Technology without talking about the computer. The origins of IT date back to the mid-20th century when the first electronic computers were developed. 
                        These early IT systems were primarily used by government agencies and large corporations for complex calculations and data management. By the 1980s, innovations from companies such as Apple and IBM 
                        changed the IT world by making computing accessible to individuals with the induction of the personal computers (PC) and Graphical User Interface (GUI).

                         so did the volume of data generated. Big Data and advanced analytics emerged to help organization make sense of the vast information.</p>
